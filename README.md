### Current Project: Sentiment Voice

 I'm currently working on Sentiment Voice for my Senior Design Capstone at VCU. The project is a transformative VR experience integrating user emotions into an adaptive environment. The goal of the project is to shed light on emotional data tracking in tech for public awareness and engagement. I'm currently working alongside 3 other CS students as well as artists in the School of Kinetic Imaging.

 Here's what's my role is:
- Access facial expression data tracked with the Meta Quest Pro
- Collect data for 4 different emotions expressed by users : Happy, Mad, Sad, Anxious.
- Train a ML Model to make predictions on what emotion the user is using based off positions on the face.
